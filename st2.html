        <p>This article talks about the plight of the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hossain and Zablotska-Manos mention how the Rohingya people have increased vulnerabilities to HIV and other diseases and that socio-cultural and behavioral factors have lowered their chances at getting treatment along with the existing economic factors that have already affected them. </p>

        <p>These kind of people have escaped from Myanmar due to violence and genocide and they long for rehabilitation from the violence and to be accepted into Bangladeshâ€™s society. Rehabilitation is hard for this population since the government is not providing effective care and negative social factors are coming into play along with existing health risks like an increased risk of STIs.</p>
