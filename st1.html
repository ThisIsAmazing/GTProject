        <p>This article talks about the conditions of Indian labor workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nomani mentions that the Indian working class fell into economic instability, scarcity of resources, and mental illness. These workers do not have job security nor an adequate salary and are at a high risk of COVID-19 due to the appalling and cramped living conditions that they live in.</p>

        <p>The working class have a value to earn money because they sought to gain economic stability. Most people in the working class are from impoverished conditions and came to work to fulfill their values. The working class are living in ridiculous living conditions, have inadequate pay, and no job security, which makes earning money such a struggle for the working class.</p>
