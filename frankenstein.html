        <h1>Frankenstein text description</h1>
        <p>Frankenstein by Mary Shelley is about a character,
          Victor Frankenstein, who sets out to gain a lot of
          knowledge and uses that knowledge to create a monster.
          That monster then initially proceeds to haunt him and his
           loved ones but decides to give Frankenstein a chance to
           redeem himself after the monster told his story about his plight.
            Unfortunately, Frankenstein refused to comply with his needs,
            and he ended up haunting him for the rest of the book.</p>

        <h1>Frankenstein text connection</h1>
        <p>The monster in the story talks about what he went through
           starting from his creation. He mentions how his interaction
            with people ended up in total disaster, no matter what he did,
            and that he was often alone since there was nobody like him.
            This leads him to have a value for a companion. He wants to
            share his plight to someone who is facing the same problems
            that he is and he wants someone who is identical to him so
            that he would not feel lonely anymore.</p>
