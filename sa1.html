        <p>The Iraqi people are stressed about what will happen to them, and are worried about their fate. This causes them to have a value of being safe from Iraq and to be successful in the new country that they have landed in. They do not want to be deported back to Iraq in fear of being persecuted by the government and they want to have a good fate in the new place that they are in.</p>
